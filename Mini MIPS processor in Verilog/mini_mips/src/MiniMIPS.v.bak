//this module is a top-level entity
//all modules in this project that have to use just structural verilog (except register & data modules)
//MiniMIPS has to work correctly for 15 instruction.
//alu32 design has to stay same with assignment3

//Verilog coding guidelines 
//Guideline #1: When modeling sequential logic, use nonblocking assignments.
//Guideline #2: When modeling latches, use nonblocking assignments.
//Guideline #3: When modeling combinational logic with an always block, use blocking assignments.
